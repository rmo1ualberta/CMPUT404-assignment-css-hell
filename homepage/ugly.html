                        <p>Some how custom mechanical keyboards grabbed my attention... Itâ€™s probably due to my attraction to well designed products (design overall)
                             and the aesthetics that comes with pairing such a thing with various other well designed products. As well, the tinkering aspect of
                              building a keyboard is something I enjoy a lot as well. </p>

                            experience and is a good excuse to get away from the screens. And as a result I get to eat good food :D
